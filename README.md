**Please Note:**
- **I do not take responsibility of the compilation of the jailbroken application as it is build for iOS 7 devices and I do no longer own a device with iOS 7 that I can build and test with.**
- **My real name is Rutvik Sanghavi, and I go by the alias Orangebananaspy within the jailbreak community. Initially it was intended to conceal my real identity**
